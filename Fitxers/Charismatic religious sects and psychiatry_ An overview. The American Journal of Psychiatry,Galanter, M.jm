Phenomena associated with contemporary charismatic religious sects raise questions about the combined impact of group influence and intensely held beliefs on group members' psychological functioning. The stages of membership in these sects are discussed, with emphasis on psychiatric aspects of conversion, long-term membership, and leaving. Options for psychiatric intervention are considered, including psychotherapy, conservatorships, and deprogramming. Systems theory is used to provide a psychological model for the relationship between group influence in these sects and current conceptions of individual psychopathology and normal adaptation.
