The number of users of social networks (SN) has increased dramatically during the last years. In turn, the number of applications offered by SNs, as well as their usage by SN users, has also increased significantly. These applications are developed by third parties and access users' data to operate. This fact poses serious privacy risks, since SNs do not provide mechanisms to specify users' privacy preferences for the usage done by third party applications over their personal data. This paper proposes a solution based on the usage of access control languages to keep track of the usage done by SN applications of users' personal data
